## Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) Wheat Dataset
-The dataset is constructed with a VNIR camera that is able to capture the spectral information between wavelength range of 400 nm to 1100 nm.
-There are 40 wheat samples.
-Each captured image is in the form of 640 x 512 pixels. 
-Two 100-W halogen light sources are used by positioning at the left side of SWIR and right side of RGB to ensure homogeneous light distribution.
