Coming soon.


## Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) Wheat Dataset
- The dataset is constructed with a VNIR camera that is able to capture the spectral information between wavelength range of 400 nm to 1100 nm.
- There are 40 wheat samples.
- A captured image is in the form of 640 x 512 pixels. 
- Then, each image is divided into four quadrants for data augmentation.
- Two 100-W halogen light sources are used by positioning at the left side of SWIR and right side of RGB to ensure homogeneous light distribution.

## Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) Wheat Dataset
- The dataset is constructed with a SWIR camera that is able to capture the spectral information between wavelength range of 900 nm to 1700 nm.
- There are 40 wheat samples.
- A captured image is  in the form of 640 x 512 pixels. 
- Then, each image is divided into four quadrants for data augmentation.
- Two 100-W halogen light sources are used by positioning at the left side of SWIR and right side of RGB to ensure homogeneous light distribution.

## RGB Wheat Dataset
- The RGB images are captured with a specific camera.
- There are 40 wheat samples.
- A captured image is in the form of 1280 x 1024 pixels.
- Then, each image is divided into four quadrants for data augmentation.
- Two 100-W halogen light sources are used by positioning at the left side of SWIR and right side of RGB to ensure homogeneous light distribution.
